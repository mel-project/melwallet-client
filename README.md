The defacto tool used to communicate with the Themelio wallet daemon, [`melwalletd`](https://github.com/themeliolabs/melwalletd). `melwallet-cli`  formats and send requests to the blockchain, prompting the user for when neccessary. This tool aims to offer the flexiblity of interacting directly with the `melwalletd` REST api with many additional benefits, including:

+ useful help messages 
+ automatic response output formatting
+ automatic transaction preparation and request formatting


## Installation

`melwallet-client` is a rust crate so the easiest way to install is with `cargo`. If not already installed, be sure to also install `melwalletd`

``` 
cargo install --locked melwallet-cli melwalletd
```
