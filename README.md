The defacto tool used to communicate with the Themelio wallet daemon, [`melwalletd`](https://github.com/themeliolabs/melwalletd). `melwallet-cli`  formats and send requests to the blockchain, prompting the user for when necessary. This tool aims to offer the flexibility of interacting directly with the `melwalletd` REST api with many additional benefits, including:

+ useful help messages 
+ automatic response output formatting
+ automatic transaction preparation and request formatting


## Installation

`melwallet-client` is a rust crate so the easiest way to install is with `cargo`. If not already installed, be sure to also install `melwalletd`

``` 
cargo install --locked melwallet-cli melwalletd
```

For a quick intro to using this software, checkout [this quick guide] on the Themelio docs page(https://docs.themelio.org/try-themelio/my-first-tx/)

    melwallet-cli send [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] -w <wallet>

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
        --raw
    -V, --version    Prints version information

OPTIONS:
        --add-covenant <add-covenant>...    Additional covenants. This often must be specified if we are spending coins
                                            that belong to other addresses, like covenant coins

                                            1 ÂµMEL to $ADDRESS. Can be specified multiple times to send money to

## Basic Uses

As a thin-client of `melwalletd`, `melwallet-cli` needs access to an instance of `melwalletd`. Learn how to run the wallet daemon on the docs page: https://docs.themelio.org/try-themelio/my-first-tx/. The rest of the documentation assumes `melwalletd` is running locally in the background.
### `create`

``` 
$ melwallet-cli create -w test_wallet
Enter password: <your password>
Wallet name:  test_wallet (locked)
Network:      testnet
Address:      t20aexrbvnxgcpmyzbzcemv8651s40rqe0we8a33ebadyrhb87k930
Balance:      0.000000  MEL
Staked:       0.000000  SYM
```

As you can see here we used the `create` subcommand with the `-w` flag, short for `--wallet`, to create a wallet named `test_wallet`. This command outputs a formatted summary of the newly created wallet.


### `send-faucet` (testnet only)

```
$ melwallet-cli send-faucet -w test_wallet
Transaction hash:  c55cb04275fe0d6c618a51e04eb82b1a43487b499d8cca28d5d7ec2247f5047d
(wait for confirmation with melwallet-cli wait-confirmation -w test_wallet c55cb04275fe0d6c618a51e04eb82b1a43487b499d8cca28d5d7ec2247f5047d)
```

When needed, 1001 fake `MEL` can be collected from the network using the `send-faucet` verb. This verb outputs the transaction hash, and a `melwallet-cli` command using the `wait-confirmation` verb. 

```
melwallet-cli wait-confirmation -w test_wallet c55cb04275fe0d6c618a51e04eb82b1a43487b499d8cca28d5d7ec2247f5047d
```

If used, this command will cause the terminal to wait for a transaction to be accepted by the Themelio blockchain.



### `summary`

```
$ melwallet-cli summary -w test_wallet
Wallet name:  test_wallet (locked)
Network:      testnet
Address:      t20aexrbvnxgcpmyzbzcemv8651s40rqe0we8a33ebadyrhb87k930
Balance:      1001.000000  MEL
Staked:       0.000000     SYM
```

This command outputs a wallet summary for the wallet name specified by `-w`, `test_wallet`, consisting of the `network` this wallet belongs to, the `address` associated with this wallet, the `balance` (which contains `MEL` from a `send-faucet` transaction), and the amount of `SYM` staked on the network; identical to the summary produced by the verb, [`create`](#create)

### `send`

```
$ melwallet-cli send -w testing123 --to t22272fg9r0k8k09qj06drzzjq9e0rw3asxfs1zrnaccwv5j6gq5tg,0.0001,MEL,68656c6c6f20776f726c64
TRANSACTION RECIPIENTS
Address                                                 Amount          Additional data
t22272fg9r0k8k09qj06drzzjq9e0rw3asxfs1zrnaccwv5j6gq5tg  0.000100 MEL    "68656c6c6f20776f726c64"
t22272fg9r0k8k09qj06drzzjq9e0rw3asxfs1zrnaccwv5j6gq5tg  124.999685 MEL  ""
t22272fg9r0k8k09qj06drzzjq9e0rw3asxfs1zrnaccwv5j6gq5tg  124.999686 MEL  ""

Proceed? [y/N] y
Transaction hash:  818336401d0d1303d182aa83926f9d0fc288e12cdbf5d473327a255babed55f6
(wait for confirmation with melwallet-cli wait-confirmation -w testing123 818336401d0d1303d182aa83926f9d0fc288e12cdbf5d473327a255babed55f6)
```

The `--to` flag of the send command has four comma-delimitted fields; from the help doc:
```
FORMAT: "destination,amount[,denom[,additional_data]]"
```

+ `desination`: the wallet address to send funds
+ `amount`: A number requiring a decimal and numbers to either side of it; ex: 1.0, 0.01
+ `denom`: the type (denomination) of coin being sent; the native options are MEL,SYM, and ERG
+ `additional_data`: hex or ascii encoded data included in the transaction

In the above example the `additional_data` field, `68656c6c6f20776f726c64`, is the hex encoding of `hello world`. `melwallet-cli` is capable of encoding ascii strings as hex automatcally using `ascii=` like this
```

```
 Use `send --help` for 

```
FORMAT: "destination,amount[,denom[,additional_data]]"
```


```
melwallet-cli send --help
```


## Advanced Uses

`melwallet-cli` can also be used to deploy scripts, called covenants, on Themelio. Learn more about deploying covenants [here](https://guide.melodeonlang.org/9_deploying_covenants.html).
